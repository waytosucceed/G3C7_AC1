                       "Once upon a time, in a small and cosy burrow, there lived a little hamster named Henry. Henry loved to sleep, but most of all, he loved to dream. Every night, as he nestled down in his soft bed of hay, he closed his eyes and let his mind take him on the most incredible adventures.",

The same goes for words like 'met,' 'sit,' 'dot,' and 'mug' – the vowel sounds are short because they're followed by consonants. <br><br> Repeat all of these words:   <span style='font-weight:bolder;'> Cat, Mug, Sit, Dot, Met </span> <br><br>Can you hear how the “vowel sound” was so short in these words?",

                        "One night, as Henry drifted off to sleep, he found himself in a magical forest. The trees were tall and shimmering, and the leaves rustled softly in the breeze. Henry felt a warm sunbeam on his face and looked up to see the most stunning rainbow in the sky.",

                        "In this sentence, we can find: <br><br> ● The long 'i' sound in 'night' <br> ● The long 'e' sound in 'sleep' <br> ● The long 'ou' sound in 'found' <br><br>These are called long vowel sounds.",

                        " <span style='background-color: yellow;color: blue;'>For example</span>, in the word 'cake,'the vowel sound you hear is a long 'a' sound,pronounced as 'ay.' This is different from the short 'a' sound in the word 'cat,'which is pronounced quickly and briefly.  <br><br> Did you notice any difference while pronouncing it? <br><br>  <span style='background-color: yellow;color: blue;'> For example</span>: <br> ● Vowel <span style='color:blueviolet;font-style:italic;'> “i” </span> in the word “ <span style='font-weight: bolder;'>blind</span>” <br> ● Vowel <span style='color:blueviolet;font-style:italic;'>“u” </span> in the word “ <span style='font-weight: bolder;'>cumin</span>” <br> ● Vowel  <span style='color:blueviolet;font-style:italic;'>“o” </span> in the word “ <span style='font-weight: bolder;'>note</span>” <br> <br> While pronouncing all these words, you can notice that the sound of the vowel is extended for a longer duration, which is not the case in words like 'cat,' 'truck,' and 'pit,' where the sound of the vowel is quick.",

Without hesitation, Henry offered to help the rabbit find his way back. <br><br> They walked for what seemed like hours, and just when the rabbit was about to give up hope, they came across a field of flowers. The flowers were so colourful and smelled so sweet that the rabbit’s tears turned into a smile. With the help of the flowers, the rabbit was able to remember the way back home, and he thanked Henry for his help.",
